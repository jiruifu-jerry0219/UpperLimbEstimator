# Estimate the Joint Kinematics and Joint Torque from Surface EMG data
#### What include?
This project includes the program to estimate both joint kinematics and joint torque for the upper limb by using surface electromyography signal. 
#### Steps:
1. Data preprocessing and feature extraction by using the MATLAB
2. Training the regression model with the processed data, the regression program is written in Python.
* Currently, we are working on convert our MATLAB data preprocessing program to Python and will update soon.
