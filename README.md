# Estimate the Joint Kinematics and Joint Torque from Surface EMG data
#### What include?
This project includes the program to estimate both joint kinematics and joint torque for the upper limb by using surface electromyography signal. We also upload the surface EMG data we used to train the estimator to this repo. for replication.
#### Method
1. Artificial neural network
2. Gaussian Process
