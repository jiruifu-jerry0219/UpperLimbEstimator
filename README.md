# Estimate the Joint Kinematics and Joint Torque from Surface EMG data
#### What include?
This project includes the program to estimate both joint kinematics and joint torque for the upper limb by using surface electromyography signal. We also upload the surface EMG data we used to train the estimator to this repo. for replication.
#### Steps:
1. Data preprocessing and feature extraction by using the MATLAB
2. Training the regression model with the processed data, the regression program is written in Python.
3. * Currently, we are working on convert our MATLAB data preprocessing program to Python and will update soon.
